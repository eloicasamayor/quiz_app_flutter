# flutter_course

A new Flutter project.

## Following the course

Developed following this udemy course [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2021 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)

## Learning Notes
### Create flutter project
Command to create a flutter project from the terminal. The project name cannot contain spaces or dashes
        flutter create name_of_the_project

### Material Design
It's a design system created and heavily used by Google. It's highly customizable and works on iOS too. Whils material design is built into Flutter, there are alsom Apple styled widgets in the Flutter framework (Cuppertino widgets).

### Flutter vs alternatives
#### Flutter 
- uses the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework
- You get compiled Native apps. Great performance.
- Does NOT compile to iOS / Android UI Component. Flutter controlls every pixel of the app, so there is a lot of flexibility on the customisation.
- You can build Cross-platform (mobile, web, desktop)
- Developed by Google
#### React Native
- uses JavaScript and the React.js library
- You get partialy compiled native apps. Some parts are not compiled but enclosed in the native app and runs as javascript in the native app.
- Does compile to iOS / Android UI Components. There is less customization options as there are UI components restrictions.
- You can build mostly mobile apps ( + React Native web)
- Developed by Facebook
#### Ionic
- uses only Javascript. No frameworks.
- You get webApp wrapped as a Native app. The advantage is that you can use normal web technologies. A dawnside could be performance.
- Does not compile to native UI Components. You can build it as in web.
- you can build Cross-platform (mobile, web, desktop)
- Developed by Ionic

### IDE: Visual Studio Code
In order to work with Visual Studio and Flutter really well we should install some **extensions**:
- Flutter
- Dart (it's installed automatically when installing the Flutter extension)

#### Folder structure 
- **/.idea**: holds some configuration for Android Studio
- **/.vscode**: holds configurations for the IDE. It's created only when you do changes of the vs code config
- **android**: it holds a complete android project. This is the project which the Flutter SDK will use to merge the flutter code into it. Normally, this is a passive folder, it will be used by flutter but we don't need to work on it.
- **/build**: it is generated and managed by the flutter SDK. We shouldn't change anythng in here. It holds the output of the flutter aplication.
- **/ios**: is the same as android, but for ios projects. It only exists in when you work in mac, because only there you can build ios app.
- **/lib**: here we will add **all the dart files**. Here we will work 99% of the time and here is located all our dart code.
- **/test**: this folder is where we can put the automated tests. Code that runs our code and tests it for bugs or errors.
- **.gitignore**: the file to configure the list of files we want to ignore in the git commits. It's optional, only important when using GIT.
- **.metadata**: it's not a file we will work on. it's automatically generated by flutter.
- **.packages**: generated automatically by the flutter sdk.
- **name_of_project.iml**: we will not work on it. Automatically made by flutter and includes some dependencies.
- **pubspeck.lock**: is a file generated automatically based on the pubspec.yaml file. It holds more details about all the dependencies of the project. It's required by flutter but we won't work on it.
- **pubspeck.yaml**: we will work in this file. Here we **configure the dependencies** of the project, the third party packages we may be using. We will also configure other things like fonts, images. It's written in yaml, a text format where indentation is very important.
- **readme.md**: is the text file where we can include some information of the project. Is the file you are reading right now.

### Emulator
Start Android Studio > Configure > AVD Manager
Create Virtual Device > Phone > Pick one phone > pick last Android stable version image > finish

Run the app:
- From terminal: "flutter run" command
- From the visual studio menÃº: "debug" > "start Debugging" or "start without debugging"

## widgets
- In a flutter project, the depeloper build an UI by adding **widgets**, the building blocks of the user interface. 
    - There are a lot of **built in widgets**, shipped with the flutter framework. There are widgets for everything: for text, for buttons, for images... You can configure all the widgets to change their appereance.
    - We can also make our own **custom widgets**, grouping some others putting them somewhere in the screen.

## Some Dart basics

### Functions
Functions are code snippets that you can execute multiple times and any time you want. It is defined by:
-  A **function name**. It has to follow a naming convention which is called camelcase. It should not have spaces between words. The first word whould start with a lowercase character and the other words will start with uppercase letters. **"main"** is a special function name. The main function is the entry point of a dart application, it is the first function to be called automatically by dart when the app starts. 
- **Parentesis**, where the function can recive **arguments**, the inputs for the function. The arguments are separed by commas and they can have any name we want.
- Then we have the **curly braces** that surround the **function body**, the code executed when the function gets called. 
Before the function name there is the **type** of the function. Dart is a typed language, which means that everything has a type. So the type indicates what type of data the function returns. When it returns nothing, the return type is void.
